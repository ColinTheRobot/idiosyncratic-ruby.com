Why I — still — often use Ruby: It is a language with a **terrific community** (welcoming and always questioning itself) and **ecosystem** (a lot of problems [already](https://rubygems.org/) [solved](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/)), which is **beautiful** (focus on productivity), a little **conservative** (easy to work with), and **general purpose** (a good choice in most cases).
