This is a summary of reasons why you should still use Ruby:

It is a language with a **terrific community** (welcoming and always questioning itself) and **ecosystem** (a lot of problems [already](https://rubygems.org/) [solved](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/)), which is **beautiful** (focus on productivity), a little **conservative** (in the sense that it is easy to work with), and **general purpose** (a good choice in most cases).

For a deeper understanding of Ruby's principles, reading [matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) is highly recommended:
